READ ME
I've done simple web pages before but now I'm really making an efford to learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages. I thought making a portfolio page
would be a great way to put what I've learned in a test, learn more on the way
and show others what I can do.

One day I'd like to be employed as Front End, Back End or Fullstack dev, so here we go!
